# RichnessPatternsAlongEnvironmentalGradients
The model presented in the main text of the Jouirnal of Biogeography paper “The origin of species richness patterns along environmental gradients: uniting explanations based on time, diversification rate and carrying capacity" by Mikael Pontarp and John J. Wiens. The model is implemented in its basic form as MATLAB code. To run the model “main_simulation_prog_5pach.m” should be executed in the same directory as the other m-files. The code is commented within each m-file, below we present general features and key components of the implementation.
